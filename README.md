I'm Kobe. I live in California. 

I've used Linux/BSD in personal and professional environments since 1999.

In all that time, I never learned to code. I know very basic scripting principles. 

I would like to know more!

I use Apple products almost exclusively these days, so am interested in Swift/Objective-C projects that will help me along my journey.

I am also very interested in localization, as I know several (people) languages.

You can find me on Discord/smolkobe#2807 to chat in real time.
